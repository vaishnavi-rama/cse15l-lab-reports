## Lab Report 2

### Part 1 

### Part 2
The absolute path to the private key is /Users/vramanujan/.ssh/id_rsa. 



ssh, which stands for secure shell network, and we are using it in this case, to securely log in to a remote server. Because we used ssh-keygen during the lab to generate a public ssh key that we then copied onto the remote ieng6 machine with the scp command, we are able to use the ssh protocol to login to the ieng6 machine without a password. Attached below is a screen shot of when I enter the command ssh vramanujan@ieng6.ucsd.edu into my terminal, I am no longer prompted for a password. Instead, I see a Notice that tells me about the conditions of using the ieng6 machine, as shown in the screenshot, which means I have successfully logged into the machine without a password.     


### Part 3
During lab, I learned how to use the curl command to access web pages we created by passing in a url as an argument to the command prompt, which I didn't know before. We are able to see the contents of the web page printed out as an output to the terminal. We used the curl command in lab to access the server we created. Looking up documentation for the curl command, I learned that curl stands for Client URL and this command allows data to be transferred between a device and a server.
